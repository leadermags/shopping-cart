# Shopping Cart System

This project simulates a Shopping Cart System for books using Visual Basic.NET

Users can utilize the tabs to access different windows. Users can choose between Audio Books and Printed Books then a new form window will open for the one chosen. After adding a product to the list, users can choose to remove the product. Costs are calculated automatically.

This project aims to be intutive and user-friendly.
